        <p>
            The mission of Web In Progress is to Create a better form of interacting with the internet.<br>
            Students of Eastern Michigan University, in concert with faculty and staff, will build, launch,
            and maintain an all new website for EMU.

            <h2>Our Vision</h2>
            <p>
                We envision an open source internet. A system to share data, information, ideas, art and culture
                in a way that empowers the user and promotes accessibility, function, and innovation.

            <h2>The Current Site</h2>
            <p>
                To understand our mission let's first look at the current Eastern Michigan University website.
                The university currently uses a <a>Content Management System (CMS).</a>
                This CMS has proven itself convenient, to the detriment of innovation. As a university, each of
                us is uniquely positioned to collaborate in ways that the workforce outside will never match.
                A CMS offers to streamline every step of web development, at the cost of invaluable learning
                opportunities.

                <div class="content">

                        <h4>Third Party Dependencies</h4>
                        <p>
                            Relying on a third party CMS means that we are at the mercy of their update schedule,
                            security protocols, and feature set. I'd like to remind you of the Canvas outage that
                            occurred in October 20th. That was caused by a 
                            <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/message/101925/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">major AWS outage</a>.
                            Managing our own website would remove external points of failure, so when issues arise,
                            we can address them directly.
                        </p>

                    <div>
                        <h4>Limited Customization</h4>
                        <p>
                            A CMS often comes with pre-designed templates and themes that limit the ability to
                            create a unique and tailored user experience. By building our own website, we can
                            customize every aspect to better reflect the university's identity and meet the specific
                            needs of our community. If you feel that the internet has become too homogenized, this is
                            exactly the issue here. Using a CMS means that many websites end up looking and feeling
                            the same.<br>

                            This award winning site by <a href="https://www.fastspot.com/services" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Fastspot</a>
                            is a shining example of creative web design, design that communicates with more than words or images.

                        <h4>An inconsistent User Experience</h4>
                        <p>
                            Please <a href="https://www.emich.edu/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">visit the EMU website</a>
                            and click through the navigation menu. Notice that 'About' and 'Academics' keep the same navigation
                            bar. Making it feel like we are still on the same page. Clicking on 'Admissions' however, replaces the
                            navigation bar. 'Athletics' takes you to a completely different website. This may seem nitpicky, but
                            the inconsistencies build on each other. Not to mention that we as students have to navigate to and from
                            emich.edu, canvas, MyEmich, emueagles, gmail, and any number of other sites every day. Do you ever use Eaglesync?
                            Can you navigate to it from the emich.edu homepage? The user experience can always be improved, with the
                            same CMS even. But building our own site gives us the freedom to design a seamless experience from the ground up.

            <h2>The Internet</h2>
            <p>
                Currently extracts user data for the profit of a few large corporations. This is why it is important
                to build something better. It no longer makes sense to host our websites on servers owned by these
                corporations. The hardware necessary to run a website is as accessible as ever, and open source software
                has matured to the point where we can build a secure, reliable, and high performance website. One that
                can serve as a model for the future of the internet.
