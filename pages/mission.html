        <p>
            The mission of Web In Progress is to Create a better form of interacting with the internet.<br>
            Students of Eastern Michigan University, in concert with faculty and staff, will build, launch,
            and maintain an all new website for EMU.

            <h2>Our Vision</h2>
            <p>
                We envision an open source internet. A system to share data, information, ideas, art and culture
                in a way that empowers the user and promotes accessibility, function, and innovation.

            <h2>The Current Site</h2>
            <p>
                To understand the mission let's first look at the current Eastern Michigan University website.
                The university currently uses a <a>Content Management System (CMS).</a>
                This CMS has proven itself convenient, to the detriment of innovation. As a university, each of
                us is uniquely positioned to collaborate in ways that the workforce outside will never match.
                A CMS offers to streamline every step of web development, at the cost of invaluable learning
                opportunities.

                <div class="content">
                    <div>
                        <h4>Third Party Dependencies</h4>
                        <p>
                            Relying on a third party CMS means that we are at the mercy of their update schedule,
                            security protocols, and feature set. I'd like to remind you of the Canvas outage that
                            occurred in October 20th. That was caused by a 
                            <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/message/101925/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">major AWS outage</a>.
                            Managing our own website would remove external points of failure, so when issues arise,
                            we can address them directly.
                        </p>

                        <h4>Limited Customization</h4>
                        <p>
                            A CMS often comes with pre-designed templates and themes that limit the ability to
                            create a unique and tailored user experience. By building our own website, we can
                            customize every aspect to better reflect the university's identity and meet the specific
                            needs of our community.
