            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>
                Web In Proggress is recruiting students who want to build the future of the internet by their own power, and advisors who want to help them achieve that goal.

            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>
                My name is Jose Daniel Guevara. I am majoring in Arts and Entertainment Managements.
                Art is my greatest passion, and I wish to see a world where art can be freely shared and enjoyed by all.
                I believe that the internet has the power to elevate art and culture, but that potential is limited by the interests that
                currently control it. I need your help to change that.

            <h2>Goals</h2>
            <h3>Register as a Student Organization</h3>
            <p>
                The initial goal is to be recognized by the university as an official student organization.<br>
                For this we must:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Recruit at least 3 members.</li>
                <li>Find a faculty or staff advisor.</li>
                <li>Create a constitution and bylaws.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Members need not be experts in web development. Enthusiasm and willingness to learn are more important.<br>
                Key roles we need to fill include:
                <ul>
                    <li type="button" class="collapsible"> President</li>
                    <p class="content"> The president will lead meetings, coordinate activities, and represent the organization to the university.</p>
                    <li type="button" class="collapsible"> Treasurer</li>
                    <p class="content"> The treasurer will manage the organization's finances, including budgeting and fundraising.</p>
                    <li type="button" class="collapsible"> Secretary</li>
                    <p class="content"> The secretary will keep records of meetings, manage communications, and maintain the organization's documentation.</p>
                    <li type="button" class="collapsible"> Lead Developer</li>
                    <p class="content"> The lead developer will oversee the technical aspects of the organization's web projects, guiding other members in development tasks.</p>
                    <li type="button" class="collapsible"> Faculty Advisor</li>
                    <p class="content"> The faculty advisor will provide guidance, support, and mentorship to the student members, helping to navigate university policies and resources.</p>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <h3>Build and Launch an All New Website for Eastern Michigan University</h3>
            <div>
                The mission of Web In Proggress is to create a better form of interacting with the internet.
                By building a new website for Eastern Michigan University, we can showcase the talents of our members while providing a superior user experience for students, faculty, staff, and visitors.
                If you're not familiar with how the internet works, This is a good resource to learn more.
                The problem we aim to address is that the university uses a third party service to host its website.
                That is, we pay for someone else to create and maintain our website. While this may seem convenient, it comes with several 
                <b type="button" class="collapsible">drawbacks:</b> <div class="content">Building and maintaining the school's site is a tremendous learning and research opportunity for students, faculty, staff, and the wider community alike. 
                    by outsourcing this function, we miss out on the chance to develop our own skills and knowledge in web development and design.
                    Further, the CMS we currently use and other costs involved, are exactly that, costs, and we suggest that it will be cheaper to do it ourselves.</div>
                We wish to address these issues by building the new website ourselves, with a fresh vision and commitment to accessibility, function, and innovation.
                The first hurdle to overcome is to be recognized as an official student organization. If you want to be a part of this journey, <a href="contact.html">contact us</a>!
